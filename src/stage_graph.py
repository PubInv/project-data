# Now beginning working on the order concept
# A basic approach is that a an order can be generated from a SupplyTree,
# in that a StageGraph is very similar to a Supply Tree.
# A StageGraph can be considered a SupplyTree decorated by human assertions and
# boolean conditions. The fundamental operations on a StageGraph
# are to advance conditions with assertions, and to compute what needs
# to be advanced. Our eventual goal is to be able to repair and order
# by changing the SupplyTree in some way. So our new types are:
# StageAssertion
# StageGraph
# Order
